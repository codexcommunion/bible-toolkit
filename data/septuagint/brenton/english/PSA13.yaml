  text: 'They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing,
    there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with
    their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose
    mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction
    and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there
    is no fear of God before their eyes.'
