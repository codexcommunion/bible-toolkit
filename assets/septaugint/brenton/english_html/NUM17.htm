and they became a sign to the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest took the brazen censers, which the men who had been burnt brought near, and they put them as a covering on the altar:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>a memorial to the children of Israel that no stranger might draw nigh, who is not of the seed of Aaron, to offer incense before the Lord; so he shall not be as Core and as they that conspired with him, as the Lord spoke to him by the hand of Moses.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the children of Israel murmured the next day against Moses and Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the congregation combined against Moses and Aaron, that they ran impetuously to the tabernacle of witness; and the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron went in, in front of the tabernacle of witness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Depart out of the midst of this congregation, and I will consume them at once: and they fell upon their faces.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put on it fire from the altar, and put incense on it, and carry it away quickly into the camp, and make atonement for them; for wrath is gone forth from the presence of the Lord, it has begun to destroy the people.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Aaron took as Moses spoke to him, and ran among the congregation, for already the plague had begun among the people; and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague ceased.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that died on account of Core.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and the plague ceased.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and take <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Gr. a rod.</span></a>rods of them, according to the houses of their families, a rod from all their princes, according to the houses of their families, twelve rods, and write the name of each on his rod.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And write the name of Aaron on the rod of Levi;
