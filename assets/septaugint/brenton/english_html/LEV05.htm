he shall not pour oil upon it, nor shall he put frankincense upon it, because it is a sin-offering.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he shall bring it to the priest; and the priest having taken a handful of it, shall lay the memorial of it on the altar of whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord;
