So I knew that it was the word of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I bought the field of Anameel the son of my father's brother, and I weighed him seventeen shekels of silver.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I wrote <span class='add'>it</span> in a book, and sealed <span class='add'>it</span>, and took the testimony of witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I took the book of the purchase that was sealed;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and I gave it to Baruch son of Nerias, son of Maasæas, in the sight of Anameel my father's brother's son, and in the sight of the men that stood by and wrote in the book of the purchase, and in the sight of the Jews that were in the court of the prison.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Take this book of the purchase, and the book that has been read; and thou shalt put it into an earthen vessel, that it may remain many days.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord; There shall yet be bought fields and houses and vineyards in this land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I prayed to the Lord after I had given the book of the purchase to Baruch the son of Nerias, saying,   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>O <span class='add'>ever</span> living Lord! thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power, and with thy high and lofty arm: nothing can be hidden from thee.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Granting mercy to thousands, and recompensing the sins of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them: the great, the strong God;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the Lord of great counsel, and mighty in deeds, the great Almighty God, and Lord of great name: thine eyes are upon the ways of the children of men, to give to every one according to his way:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>who hast wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even to this day, and in Israel, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and thou didst make for thyself a name, as at this day;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and thou didst bring out thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and thou gavest them this land, which thou didst swear <span class='add'>to give</span> to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and they went in, and took it; but they hearkened not to thy voice, and walked not in thine ordinances; they did none of the things which thou didst command them, and they caused all these calamities to happen to them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold, a multitude is come against the city to take it; and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans that fight against it, by the power of the sword, and the famine: as thou hast spoken, so has it happened.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou sayest to me, Buy thee the field for money; and I wrote a book, and sealed <span class='add'>it</span>, and took the testimony of witnesses: and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: shall anything be hidden from me!
