for I the Lord your God <span class='add'>am</span> holy.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Let every one of you reverence his father and his mother; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Ye shall not follow idols, and ye shall not make to yourselves molten gods: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And if ye will sacrifice a peace-offering to the Lord, ye shall offer it acceptable from yourselves.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In what day soever ye shall sacrifice it, it shall be eaten; and on the following day, and if any of it should be left till the third day, it shall be thoroughly burnt with fire.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And if it should be at all eaten on the third day, it is unfit for sacrifice: it shall not be accepted.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy things of the Lord; and the souls that eat it shall be destroyed from among their people.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when ye reap the harvest of your land, ye shall not complete the reaping of your field with exactness, and thou shalt not gather that which falls from thy reaping.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thou shalt not go over the gathering of thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the remaining grapes of thy vineyard: thou shalt leave them for the poor and the stranger: I am the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Ye shall not steal, ye shall not lie, neither shall one bear false witness as an informer against his neighbour.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And ye shall not swear unjustly by my name, and ye shall not profane the holy name of your God: I am the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou shalt not injure thy neighbour, neither do thou rob <span class='add'>him</span>, neither shall the wages of thy hireling remain with thee until the morning.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou shalt not revile the deaf, neither shalt thou put a stumbling-block in the way of the blind;

with justice shalt thou judge thy neighbour.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt not walk deceitfully among thy people; thou shalt not rise up against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, so thou shalt not bear sin on his account.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And thy hand shall not avenge thee; and thou shalt not be angry with the children of thy people; and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; I am the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Ye shall observe my law: thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with one of a different kind, and thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diverse seed;

but they shall not die, because she was not set at liberty.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he shall bring for his trespass to the Lord to the door of the tabernacle of witness, a ram for a trespass-offering.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, before the Lord, for the sin which he sinned; and the sin which he sinned shall be forgiven him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And whenever ye shall enter into the land which the Lord your God gives you, and shall plant any fruit-tree, then shall ye purge away its uncleanness; its fruit shall be three years uncleansed to you, it shall not be eaten.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, a subject of praise to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And in the fifth year ye shall eat the fruit, its produce is an increase to you.
