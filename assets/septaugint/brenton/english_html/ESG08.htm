<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And in that day king Artaxerxes gave to Esther all that belonged to Aman the slanderer: and Mardochæus was called by the king; for Esther had shewn that he was related to her.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the king took the ring which he had taken away from Aman, and gave it to Mardochæus: and Esther appointed Mardochæus over all that had been Aman's.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And she spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and besought <span class='add'>him</span> to do away the mischief of Aman, and all that he had done against the Jews.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the king stretched out to Esther the golden sceptre: and Esther arose to stand near the king.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Esther said, If it seem good to thee, and I have found favour <span class='add'>in thy sight</span>, let an order be sent that the letters sent by Aman may be reversed, that were written for the destruction of the Jews, who are in thy kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For how shall I be able to look upon the affliction of my people, and how shall I be able to survive the destruction of my kindred?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the king said to Esther, If I have given and freely granted thee all that was Aman's, and hanged him on a gallows, because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what dost thou yet further seek?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Write ye also in my name, as it seems good to you, and seal <span class='add'>it</span> with my ring: for whatever <span class='add'>orders</span> are written at the command of the king, and sealed with my ring, it is not lawful to gainsay them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So the scribes were called in the first month, which is Nisan, on the three and twentieth day of the same year; and <span class='add'>orders</span> were written to the Jews, whatever <span class='add'>the king had</span> commanded to the local governors and chiefs of the satraps, from India even to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven satraps, according to the several provinces, according to their dialects.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they were written by order of the king, and sealed with his ring, and they sent the letters by the posts:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>wherein he charged them to use their <span class='add'>own</span> laws in every city, and to help each other, and to treat their adversaries, and those who attacked them, as they pleased,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>on one day in all the kingdom of Artaxerxes, on the thirteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of the twelfth month, which is Adar.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">12a&#160;</span>And the following is the copy of the letter of the orders.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">12b&#160;</span>[The great king Artaxerxes sends greeting to the rulers of provinces <span class='add'>in</span> a hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests.   <span class="verse" id="V15">12c&#160;</span>Many who have been frequently honoured by the most abundant kindness of their benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavour to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavour to plot against their own benefactors.   <span class="verse" id="V16">12d&#160;</span>And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they suppose that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God.   <span class="verse" id="V17">12e&#160;</span>And oftentimes <span class='add'>evil</span> exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who were appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends' affairs;   <span class="verse" id="V18">12f&#160;</span>while <span class='add'>men</span>, by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple candour of the ruling powers.   <span class="verse" id="V19">12g&#160;</span>And it is possible to see <span class='add'>this</span>, not so much from more ancient traditionary accounts, as it is immediately in your power <span class='add'>to see it</span> by examining what things have been wickedly perpetrated by the baseness of men unworthily holding power.   <span class="verse" id="V20">12h&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>it is right</span> to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undisturbed peace for all men,   <span class="verse" id="V21">12i&#160;</span>adopting <span class='add'>needful</span> changes, and ever judging those cases which come under <span class='add'>our</span> notice, with truly equitable decision.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">12k&#160;</span>For whereas Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathes, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitably entertained by us,   <span class="verse" id="V23">12l&#160;</span>obtained so large a share of our universal kindness, as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all;   <span class="verse" id="V24">12m&#160;</span><span class='add'>he, however</span>, overcome by the pride <span class='add'>of his station</span>, endeavoured to deprive us of our dominion, and our life;   <span class="verse" id="V25">12n&#160;</span>having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mardochæus our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of <span class='add'>our</span> kingdom, with their whole nation.   <span class="verse" id="V26">12o&#160;</span>For by these methods he thought, having surprised us in a defenceless state, to transfer the dominion of the Persians to the Macedonians.   <span class="verse" id="V27">12p&#160;</span>But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the justest laws,   <span class="verse" id="V28">12q&#160;</span>and being the sons of the living God, the most high and mighty, who maintains the kingdom, to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">12r&#160;</span>Ye will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letters sent by Aman the son of Amadathes, because he that has done these things, has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy recompence.   <span class="verse" id="V30">12s&#160;</span><span class='add'>We enjoin you</span> then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs, and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attacked them in a time of affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V31">12t&#160;</span>For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this <span class='add'>time of</span> gladness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">12u&#160;</span>Do ye therefore also, among your <span class='add'>notable</span> feasts, keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and those who are well disposed toward the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V33">12x&#160;</span>And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire: it shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but also most hateful to wild beasts and birds for ever.]   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom, and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king's commands; and the ordinance was also published in Susa.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Mardochæus went forth robed in the royal apparel, and wearing a golden crown, and a diadem of fine purple linen: and the people in Susa saw <span class='add'>it</span> and rejoiced.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Jews had light and gladness,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>in every city and province wherever the ordinance was published: wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth: and many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews, for fear of the Jews.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
