And the Lord said, Go, and thou shalt smite these Philistines, and shalt save Keila.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the men of David said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judea; and how shall it be if we go to Keila? shall we go after the spoils of the Philistines?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And David enquired yet again of the Lord; and the Lord answered him, and said to him, Arise and go down to Keila, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hands.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So David and his men with him went to Keila, and fought with the Philistines; and they fled from before him, and he carried off their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keila.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David, that he went down with David to Keila, having an ephod in his hand.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it was told Saul that David was come to Keila: and Saul said, God has sold him into my hands, for he is shut up, having entered into a city that has gates and bars.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Saul charged all the people to go down to war to Keila, to besiege David and his men.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David knew that Saul <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Gr. is not silent concerning.</span></a>spoke openly of mischief against him: and David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And David said, Lord God of Israel, thy servant has indeed heard, that Saul seeks to come against Keila to destroy the city on my account.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Will <span class='add'>the place</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">i. e. besieged.</span></a>be shut up? and now will Saul come down, as thy <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">Verse 12 is here supplied by Alex.</span></a>servant has heard?
