all wisdom also, and knowledge of workmanship.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>the beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations of the turning <span class='add'>of the sun</span>, and change of seasons:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the circuits of years, and positions of stars:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>the natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts: the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and all such things as are either secret or manifest, <span class='add'>them</span> I know.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an understanding spirit, holy, one only, manifold, subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>kind to man, stedfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against wisdom.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
