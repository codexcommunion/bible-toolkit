  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>as the sun shining upon the temple of the most High, and as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, as lilies by the rivers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>as fire and incense in the censer, and as a vessel of beaten gold set with all manner of precious stones:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit, and as a cypress tree which groweth up to the clouds.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When he put on the robe of honour, and was clothed with the perfection of glory, when he went up to the holy altar, he made the garment of holiness honourable.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When he took the portions out of the priests' hands, he himself stood by the hearth of the altar, compassed with his brethren round about, as a young cedar in Libanus; and as palm trees compassed they him round about.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So were all the sons of Aaron in their glory, and the oblations of the Lord in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And finishing the service at the altar, that he might adorn the offering of the most high Almighty,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>he stretched out his hand to the cup, and poured of the blood of the grape, he poured out at the foot of the altar a sweetsmelling savour unto the most high King of all.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then shouted the sons of Aaron, and sounded the silver trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance before the most High.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then all the people together hasted, and fell down to the earth upon their faces to worship their Lord God Almighty, the most High.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The singers also sang praises with their voices, with great variety of sounds was there made sweet melody.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the people besought the Lord, the most High, by prayer before him that is merciful, till the solemnity of the Lord was ended, and they had finished his service.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the whole congregation of the children of Israel, to give the blessing of the Lord with his lips, and to rejoice in his name.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they bowed themselves down to worship the second time, that they might receive a blessing from the most High.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now therefore bless ye the God of all, which only doeth wondrous things every where, which exalteth our days from the womb, and dealeth with us according to his mercy.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He grant us joyfulness of heart, and that peace may be in our days in Israel for ever:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>that he would confirm his mercy with us, and deliver us at his time!
