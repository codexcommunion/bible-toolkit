  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and what he did to the host of the Egyptians, and to their chariots, and their cavalry, and their host; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overwhelm the face of them as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them until this day;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and all the things which he did to you in the wilderness until ye came into this place;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and all things that he did to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab the son of Ruben, whom the earth opening her mouth swallowed up, and their houses, and their tents, and all their substance that was with them, in the midst of all Israel:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for your eyes have seen all the mighty works of the Lord, which he wrought among you to-day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And ye shall keep all his commandments, as many as I command thee to-day, that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>that ye may live long upon the land, which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is not as the land of Egypt, whence ye came out, whensoever they sow the seed, and water it with their feet, as a garden of herbs:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is a land of mountains and plains;
