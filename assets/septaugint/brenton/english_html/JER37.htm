Thy sins have abounded beyond the multitude of thine iniquities, <span class='add'>therefore</span> they have done these things to thee. And they that spoil thee shall become a spoil, and I will give up to be plundered all that have plundered thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For I will bring about thy healing, I will heal thee of thy grievous wound, saith the Lord; for thou art called Dispersed: she is your prey, for no one seeks after her.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus said the Lord; Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob, and will have pity upon his prisoners; and the city shall be built upon her hill, and the people shall settle after their manner.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And there shall go forth from them singers, <span class='add'>even</span> the sound of men making merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not at all be diminished.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And their sons shall go in as before, and their testimonies shall be established before me, and I will visit them that afflict them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And their mighty ones shall be over them, and their prince shall proceed of themselves; and I will gather them, and they shall return to me: for who is this that has set his heart to return to me? saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the wrathful anger of the Lord has gone forth, <span class='add'>even</span> a whirlwind of anger has gone forth: it shall come upon the ungodly.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he shall execute <span class='add'>it</span>, and until he shall establish the purpose of his heart: in the latter days ye shall know these things.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
