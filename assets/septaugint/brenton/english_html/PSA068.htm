for the waters have come in to my soul.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I am stuck fast in deep mire, and there is no standing: I am come in to the depths of the sea, and a storm has overwhelmed me.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I am weary <span class='add'>of</span> crying, my throat has become hoarse; mine eyes have failed by my waiting on my God.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: my enemies that persecute me unrighteously are strengthened: then I <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Or, paid for, or, made up for.</span></a>restored that which I took not away.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my transgressions are not hidden from thee.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord of hosts, be ashamed on my account: let not them that seek thee, be ashamed on my account, O God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For I have suffered reproach for thy sake; shame has covered my face.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I became strange to my brethren, and a stranger to my mother's children.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">John 2. 17;

O God, it is a propitious time: in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Save me from the mire, that I stick not <span class='add'>in it</span>: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and from the deep waters.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let not the waterflood drown me, nor let the deep swallow me up; neither let the well shut its mouth upon me.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Hear me, O Lord; for thy mercy is good: according to the multitude of thy compassions look upon me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And turn not away thy face from thy <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">Or, son.</span></a>servant;
