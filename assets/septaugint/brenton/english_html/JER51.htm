to cut off man and woman of you, infant and suckling from the midst of Juda, to the end that not one of you should be left;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>by provoking me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which ye entered to dwell there, that ye might be cut off, and that ye might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Have ye forgotten the sins of your fathers, and the sins of the kings of Juda, and the sins of your princes, and the sins of your wives, which they wrought in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And have not ceased even to this day, and they have not kept to my ordinances, which I set before their fathers.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I do set my face against <span class='add'>you</span>   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>to destroy all the remnant that are in Egypt; and they shall fall by the sword, and by famine, and shall be consumed small and great: and they shall be for reproach, and for destruction, and for a curse.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem, with sword and with famine:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and there shall not one be preserved of the remnant of Juda that sojourn in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Juda, to which they hope in their hearts to return: they shall not return, but only they that escape.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then all the men that knew that their wives burned incense, and all the women, a great multitude, and all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathura, answered Jeremias, saying,   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span><span class='add'>As for</span> the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For we will surely perform every word that shall proceed out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, and our kings and princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and <span class='add'>so</span> we were filled with bread, and were well, and saw no evils.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, we have all been brought low, and have been consumed by sword and by famine.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And whereas we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to her, did we make cakes to her, and pour drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Jeremias answered all the people, the mighty men, and the women, and all the people that returned him <span class='add'>these</span> words for answer, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Did not the Lord remember the incense which ye burned in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, and your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land? and came it not into his heart?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord could no longer bear <span class='add'>you</span>, because of the wickedness of your doings, and because of your abominations which ye wrought; and so your land became a desolation and a waste, and a curse, as at this day;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>because of your burning incense, and <span class='add'>because</span> of the things wherein ye sinned against the Lord: and ye have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his ordinances, and in his law, and in his testimonies; and so these evils have come upon you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Jeremias said to the people, and to the women, Hear ye the word of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; Ye women have spoken with your mouth, and ye fulfilled <span class='add'>it</span> with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her: full well did ye keep to your vows, and ye have indeed performed <span class='add'>them</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, my name shall no longer be in the mouth of every Jew to say, The Lord lives, in all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For I have watched over them, to hurt them, and not to do them good: and all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt shall perish by sword and by famine, until they are utterly consumed.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they that escape the sword shall return to the land of Juda few in number, and the remnant of Juda, who have continued in the land <span class='add'>of</span> Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign to you, that I will visit you for evil.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thus said the Lord; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> give Uaphres king of Egypt into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of one that seeks his life; as I gave Sedekias king of Juda into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, his enemy, and who sought his life.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span><span class='sc'>The Word which Jeremias the Prophet</span> spoke to Baruch son of Nerias, when he wrote these words in the book from the mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord said to thee, O Baruch.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Whereas thou hast said, Alas! alas! for the Lord has laid a grievous trouble upon me; I lay down in groaning, I found no rest;   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>say thou to him, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I pull down those whom I have built up, and I pluck up those whom I have planted.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And wilt thou seek great things for thyself?
