and dwell on the land, and thou shalt be fed with the wealth of it.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Delight <span class='add'>thyself</span> in the Lord; and he shall grant thee the requests of thine heart.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Disclose thy way to the Lord, and hope in him; and he shall bring <span class='add'>it</span> to pass.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Submit thyself to the Lord, and supplicate him: fret not thyself because of him that prospers in his way, at the man that does unlawful deeds.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do evil.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but they that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be, and thou shalt seek for his place, and shalt not find <span class='add'>it</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight <span class='add'>themselves</span> in the abundance of peace.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The sinner will watch for the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy one, <span class='add'>and</span> to slay the upright in heart.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let their sword enter into their <span class='add'>own</span> heart, and their bows be broken.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A little is better to the righteous than abundant wealth of sinners.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the arms of sinners shall be broken;

and in days of famine they shall be satisfied.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honoured and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The sinner borrows, and will not pay again: but the righteous has compassion, and gives.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For they that bless him shall inherit the earth; and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the Lord supports his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I was <span class='add'>once</span> young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He is merciful, and lends continually; and his seed shall be <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Gr. for a blessing.</span></a>blessed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Turn aside from evil, and do good;
