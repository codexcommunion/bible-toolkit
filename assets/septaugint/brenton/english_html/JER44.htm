But he hearkened not to him; and Saruia caught Jeremias, and brought him to the princes.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the princes were very angry with Jeremias, and smote him, and sent him into the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made this a prison.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Jeremias came into the dungeon, and into the cells, and he remained there many days.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Sedekias sent, and called him; and the king asked him secretly, saying, Is there a word from the Lord? and he said, There is: thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jeremias said to the king, Wherein have I wronged thee, or thy servants, or this people, that thou puttest me in prison?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And where are your prophets who prophesied to you saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against this land?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now therefore, my lord the king, let my supplication come before thy face: and why dost thou send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe? and let me not on any account die there.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the king commanded, and they cast him into the prison, and gave him a loaf a day out of the place where they bake, until the bread failed out of the city.
