Woe to us! for the day has gone down, for the shadows of the day fail.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Rise, and let us go up against her by night, and destroy her foundations.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord, Hew down her trees, array a numerous force against Jerusalem. O false city; <span class='add'>there is</span> all oppression in her.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>As a cistern cools water, so her wickedness cools her, ungodliness and misery shall be heard in her, <span class='add'>as</span> continually before her.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thou shalt be chastened, O Jerusalem, with pain and the scourge, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee a desert land, which shall not be inhabited.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord, Glean, glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel: turn back <span class='add'>your hands</span> as a grape-gatherer to his basket.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>To whom shall I speak, and testify, that he may hearken? behold, thine ears are uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hear: behold, the word of the Lord is become to them a reproach, they will not at all desire it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I allowed my wrath to come to the full, yet I kept <span class='add'>it</span> in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And their houses shall be turned to others, <span class='add'>with</span> their fields and their wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For from the least of them even to the greatest they have all committed iniquity; from the priest even to the false prophet they have all wrought falsely.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they healed the breach of my people <span class='add'>imperfectly</span>, making light <span class='add'>of it</span>, and saying, Peace, peace: and where is peace?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They were ashamed because they failed; yet they were not ashamed as those who are <span class='add'>truly</span> ashamed, and they knew not their own disgrace: therefore shall they <span class='add'>utterly</span> fall when they do fall, and in the time of visitation shall they perish, said the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord; and see what is the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find purification for your souls.
