I will wait till I exist again?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then shalt thou call, and I will hearken to thee: but do not thou reject the work of thine hands.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But thou hast numbered my devices: and not one of my sins shall escape thee?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thou hast sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and marked if I have been guilty of any transgression unawares.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And verily a mountain falling will utterly be destroyed, and a rock shall be worn out of its place.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The waters wear the stones, and waters falling headlong <span class='add'>overflow</span> a heap of the earth: and thou destroyest the hope of man.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou drivest him to an end, and he is gone: thou settest thy face against him, and sendest him away;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and though his children be multiplied, he knows <span class='add'>it</span> not; and if they be few, he is not aware.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But his flesh is in pain, and his soul mourns.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
