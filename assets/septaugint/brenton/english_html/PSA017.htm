and multiplied lightnings, and routed them.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me;
