for thou dost not enquire in wisdom concerning this.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and <span class='add'>there is</span> an advantage <span class='add'>by it</span> to them that see the sun.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For wisdom in its shadow is as the shadow of silver: and the excellence of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him that has it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold the works of God: for who shall be able to straighten him whom God has made crooked?
