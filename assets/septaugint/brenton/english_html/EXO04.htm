And in those days after some time, the king of Egypt died.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses in Madiam, Go, depart into Egypt, for all that sought thy life are dead.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses took his wife and his children, and mounted them on the beasts, and returned to Egypt; and Moses took the rod <span class='add'>which he had</span> from God in his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, When thou goest and returnest to Egypt, see—all the miracles I have <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">Lit. put into thine hands.</span></a>charged thee with, thou shalt work before Pharao: and I will harden his heart, and he shall certainly not send away the people.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou shalt say to Pharao, These things saith the Lord, Israel <span class='add'>is</span> my first-born.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I said to thee, Send away my people, that they may serve me: now if thou wilt not send them away, see, I will slay thy first-born son.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass <span class='add'>that</span> the angel of the Lord met him by the way in the inn, and sought to slay him.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Sepphora having taken a stone cut off the foreskin of her son, and fell at his feet and said, The blood of the circumcision of my son is staunched:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and he departed from him, because she said, The blood of the circumcision of my son is staunched.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses; and he went and met him in the mount of God, and they kissed each other.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses reported to Aaron all the words of the Lord, which he sent, and all the things which he charged him.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered the elders of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Aaron spoke all these words, which God spoke to Moses, and wrought the miracles before the people.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the people believed and rejoiced, because God visited the children of Israel, and because he saw their affliction: and the people bowed and worshipped.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
