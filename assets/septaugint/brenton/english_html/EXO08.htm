And the lice were both on the men and on the quadrupeds.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the charmers said to Pharao, This is the finger of God. But the heart of Pharao was hardened, and he hearkened not to them, as the Lord said.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharao: and, behold, he will go forth to the water, and thou shalt say to him, These things says the Lord: Send away my people, that they may serve me in the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I send upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and upon your houses, the dog-fly; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the dog-fly, even throughout the land upon which they are.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I will distinguish marvellously in that day the land of Gesem, on which my people dwell, in which the dog-fly shall not be: that thou mayest know that I am the Lord the God of all the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will put a difference between my people and thy people, and on the morrow shall this be on the land. And the Lord did thus.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the dog-fly came in abundance into the houses of Pharao, and into the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt; and the land was destroyed by the dog-fly.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, saying, Go and sacrifice to the Lord your God in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses said, It cannot be so, for we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians; for if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before them, we shall be stoned.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>We will go a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as the Lord said to us.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Pharao said, I <span class='add'>will</span> let you go, and do ye sacrifice to your God in the wilderness, but do not go very far away: pray then for me to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses said, I then will go forth from thee and pray to God, and the dog-fly shall depart both from thy servants, and from thy people to-morrow. Do not thou, Pharao, deceive again, so as not to send the people away to do sacrifice to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to God.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord did as Moses said, and removed the dog-fly from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people, and there was not one left.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Pharao hardened his heart, even on this occasion, and he would not send the people away.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
