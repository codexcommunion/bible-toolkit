<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, and behold thou good: and, behold, this is also vanity.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I said to laughter, Madness: and to mirth, Why doest thou this?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I examined whether my heart would excite my flesh as <span class='add'>with</span> wine, (though my heart guided <span class='add'>me</span> in wisdom,) and <span class='add'>I desired</span> to lay hold of mirth, until I should see of what kind is the good to the sons of men, which they should do under the sun all the days of their life.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I enlarged my work; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them every kind of fruit-tree.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I made me pools of water, to water from them the timber-bearing wood.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I got servants and maidens, and servants were born to me in the house: also I had abundant possession of flocks and herds, beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Moreover I collected for myself both silver and gold also, and the peculiar treasures of kings and provinces: I procured me singing men and singing women, and delights of the sons of men, a butler and female cupbearers.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So I became great, and advanced beyond all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom was established to me.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whatever mine eyes desired, I withheld not from them, I withheld not my heart from all my mirth: for my heart rejoiced in all my labour; and this was my portion of all my labour.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I looked on all my works which my hands had wrought, and on my labour which I laboured to perform: and, behold, all was vanity and waywardness of spirit, and there is no advantage under the sun.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then I looked on to see wisdom, and madness, and folly: for who is the man who will follow after counsel, in all things wherein he employs it?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I saw that wisdom excels folly, as much as light excels darkness.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I perceived, even I, that one event shall happen to them all.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I said in my heart, As the event of the fool is, so shall it be to me, even to me; and to what purpose have I gained wisdom? I said moreover in my heart, This is also vanity, because the fool speaks of his abundance.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For there is no remembrance of the wise man with the fool for ever; forasmuch as now <span class='add'>in</span> the coming days all things are forgotten: and how shall the wise man die with the fool?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So I hated life; because the work that was wrought under the sun was evil before me: for all is vanity and waywardness of spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I hated the whole of my labour which I took under the sun; because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And who knows whether he will be a wise <span class='add'>man</span> or a fool? and whether he will have power over all my labour in which I laboured, and wherein I grew wise under the sun? this is also vanity.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So I went about to dismiss from my heart all my labour wherein I had laboured under the sun.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For there is <span class='add'>such</span> a man that his labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in fortitude; yet <span class='add'>this</span> man shall give his portion to one who has not laboured therein. This is also vanity and great evil.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For it happens to a man in all his labour, and in the purpose of his heart wherein he labours under the sun.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For all his days <span class='add'>are days</span> of sorrows, and vexation of spirit is his; in the night also his heart rests not. This is also vanity.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A man has nothing <span class='add'>really</span> good to eat, and to drink, and to shew his soul <span class='add'>as</span> good in his trouble. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For who shall eat, or who shall drink, without him?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>God</span> has given to the man who is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but he has given to the sinner trouble, to add and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God; for this is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
