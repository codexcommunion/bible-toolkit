# Ecclesiastical Domain Discussion
The Ecclesiastical Domain governs the approval and recognition of biblical texts by religious authorities. Different Christian and Jewish traditions have their own institutions responsible for evaluating texts and so we must consider the best way to capture the status of the evaluation process.

## Ecclesiastical Governing Bodies Considered

Different governing bodies may exist for various traditions, and each may have their own internal hierarchical structure that we need to consider and take into account. As an initial criteria, membership rates would indicate the degree of reach and impact of this project on other humans, and so should be a top consideration. Another consideration, from a practical aspect, would be the degree of open-ness and internal structure and standardization for the various bodies (is is practical to identify evaluation status from each body).

As the various Governing Bodies may operate in geographical regions with different languages, they may also have internal sub-bodies responsible for specific translations into any given language. As such, the final evaluation and verdicts may be more complex or difficult to identify for Governing Bodies which have insufficient internal authority structure and mechanisms for expressing such evaluation verdicts.

### Governing Body Evaluations and Verdicts

The first aspect is the status of the evaluation itself, and the second aspect is the result of the evaluation. While different governing bodies may have different statuses and evaluation processes, this high level abstraction should accommodate all.

Each Governing Body (e.g., Catholic Church, Orthodox Synods, Protestant Denominations, Jewish Authorities) should thus be capable of identifying:

- **Evaluation Status** – Tracks where the text is in the review process.

- **Evaluation Verdict** – The final decision made after the evaluation.

#### Evaluation Status Reference Table

| Evaluation Status            | Description                                                 | Examples |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Not Known to have been Submitted for Review** | The text has not been formally submitted for evaluation.    | AI-generated translations, personal translations. |
| **Pending Submission**       | The text is being prepared for review but not submitted yet. | A new translation awaiting church approval. |
| **Under Review**             | The governing body is actively evaluating the text.         | A Catholic translation being reviewed by a Bishop. |
| **Review Suspended**         | The review process has been paused or delayed indefinitely. | A disputed text requiring further discussion. |
| **Review Completed**         | The governing body has reached a decision and issued a verdict. | The New American Bible (NAB) after Catholic approval. |

##### Evaluation Verdict 
After an evalation has been performed, the verdict can fall into multiple broad categories such as various forms of Approval, Neutral, or Rejection/Condemnation.

## Data Structure Discussion

The nature of the data being represented and how varied the Governing Bodies can be requires an identification approach that can accomodate these structures.

For example, a common practice is to use a "namespace" in software to logically group items hierarchically, and a similar approach can be used to form unique identifiers for each governing body while also expressing the hierarchical nature where they fit.

### Generalized Form

```
CHRISTIAN::<TRADITION>::<CHURCH_ORGANIZATION>::<OPTIONAL_SUBLEVEL>...
```
