## Introduction
### The Need for Structured Access to the Bible
- The Bible is one of the most widely distributed and studied texts in human history.
- Many applications (theological studies, digital libraries, AI-driven analysis, sermon preparation, etc.) require structured access to scripture.
- Existing digital Bible formats vary significantly, making interoperability a challenge.
- Existing digital Bible formats are difficult to trust, lack transparency into origins and source materials, or authoritative lineage details to discern what use cases they might serve for users.
- A standardized programming interface (API) and data format can enable consistent, efficient access across multiple platforms and use cases in a reliable, trustworthy, and transparent manner.

### User Journeys Considered

## Data Considerations in Scope

"The Bible" is a collection of texts--the Sacred Scriptres, with each having a complex and deep history. In order to make it accessible as structured data, we must consider these nuances with care to ensure universal accomodation in respect for the historical depth and richness.

### Identifying the Relevant Domains for Standardized Scripture Access
To design a standardized way for computer systems to interact with scripture, we need to recognize the different domains that influence how biblical texts are structured, accessed, and validated. Each domain has its own set of considerations and status values that need to be accounted for in our system.

1.  **Ecclesiastical Domains** – Religious institutions oversee and regulate certain translations and commentaries of scripture. These approvals impact whether a text is recognized for doctrinal teaching, official worship, or theological study, etc.
1. **Legal Domains** – Bible translations exist under various intellectual property protections. The legal status of a text determines how it can be accessed, distributed, and reproduced.
2. **Canonical Domains** – Different religious traditions recognize different collections of texts as scripture. This domain categorizes books based on their acceptance within various canons.
3. **Linguistic Domains** – The Bible exists in thousands of languages, and translations range from highly literal to paraphrased versions.
4. **Textual Domains** – The Bible has been preserved in multiple manuscript traditions, some of which contain textual variations. Understanding these traditions is crucial for biblical scholars and textual critics.


#### Domain Discussion and Exploration
The above domains form the foundation for structuring a standardized approach to scripture access. By recognizing these influences, a digital scripture interface can ensure that users retrieve the most appropriate text based on their theological, legal, and scholarly requirements and use cases.
